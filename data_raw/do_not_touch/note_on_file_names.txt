I added at the beginning of original file names, '20XX_' for the year in question.
For example, I renamed that file:
'MissingMigrants-Global-2022-01-25--21_26_48'
as:
'2021_MissingMigrants-Global-2022-01-25--21_26_48'

Further, in data actually processed (main 'raw_data' folder), I kept only the year as the file title. For example, the file mentioned above was renamed just '2021'
